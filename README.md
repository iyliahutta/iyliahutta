ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iylia!

ðŸ‘€ I majored in Psychology back in undergrad where I specialised in Research Methods and Statistics. The skills I built up at that point led me to
my current role as a Senior Media Analyst at Meltwater where I lead a team of analysts in curating bespoke analytical reports for Meltwater's Singapore Government clients to inform their public relations decision-making.

This journey led me to exploring the field of Data Analytics and Data Science that I am actively pursuing in my bid to become a better analyst and to 
add data-driven value wherever I go.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Statistics for Data Science at Singapore Polytechnic under its Specialist Diploma in Data Science (Data Analytics). I am also experienced in R, SQL, SPSS, MPlus, Microsoft Office and Google Suite.

While you're here, please feel free to join me on my journey of learning and sharpening my Data Analytics and Data Science skills. Any and every piece of feedback
will be greatly appreciated and sought after. Thank you! ðŸ¤“
